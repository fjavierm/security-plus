# CompTIA Security+ SY0-601

This is just a WIP, the final version of these materials will be found on my [blog](https://binaricoders.dev). These are just the drafts for the different articles.

This repository is not going to be a coding repository. The purpose of this repository is to store my notes about the 'CompTIA Security+ SY0-601' learning and study.

The reason to use this format instead of the usual blog format, [Binary Coders]((https://binaricoders.dev)), is that
this is going to be a live project, I wanted to be free to edit, change or redo the different sections and be able to
write this in a non-linear way. Be able to review things and add new information to the sections already finished.

I hope, if you have landed here, this document can be of any use to you.
